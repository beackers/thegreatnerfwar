# Yes... we're skipping version 1.2
I initially had a 1.2 plan in mind but there was a lot of stuff I already had to do so it got shoved to the back of the metamorphical waist-high pile of papers.
#Pre-released
Standard "has-not-been-tested please-proceed-with-caution" tag. This version has not been tested. Please proceed with caution. Discuss updates in the corresponding Discussions channel.
# What's new
* Removed duels (because there was just too much confusion)
* **Changed title to avoid yet more confusion**
# Ladies and gentlemen, now introducing Capture the Flag. (it's different from capture the base. there's a new name.)
Capture The Flag suggests that yes, there are yet some flags to be captured.
# the basic basics
Players attempt to capture the other team's flag. With nerf guns.
# the not basics
GOAL: **Capture the other team's flag**
## roles
* Above all, moderators
* For all, team captains
* With all, the team
### roles in depth
#### mods
Moderators, um, _moderate_ the game, making sure everything is okay and also resolving disputes (updated from CTB1.0, disputes were previously resolved via duels). Adults not actively participating in the game act as Moderators.
By the way, they can also turn on/off lights randomly. Have fun with that, Matt Noble.
#### captains
Yeah, these guys just give orders. Captains have the final say in a group discussion (unless a Moderator is present, in which case the mod gets final say).
#### the team
Just all-around soldiers, basically. Stand firm- "he who stands for nothing falls for everything." - Alexander Hamilton (genuine quote)

## rules
### states
**Active:** actively participating in the game
**Disabled:** shot player. Shot players must take a seat for half a minute (30 seconds). Timers are not provided (meaning players do have to count on their own. jack-rabbiting not allowed).
**Suspended:** player on a moderator-defined break.  Suspended players may not participate in any way in the game.
**Medical Break:** player on a time-out for health reasons.


### setup
1. Define the play area- boundaries, off-limits, no-fire areas, etc.
2. Divide people, guns, and ammunition EQUALLY in two. If there is an extra left over, it goes to the Moderators. (set it aside.)
3. Teams **elect** captains. it is important that the captain is chosen by the team (suppose the moderators chose a terrible captain, another Charles Lee of the 21st century?)
4. Captains choose places for their flags, preferably on opposite sides of the play area. _(moderator hint: the closer the flags, the shorter the game! encourage captains to post flags on opposing sides.)_
5. Start at your flag, and **GO!**

### during the game
- There is no penalty for head shots, given that they do happen occasionally. If it is evident or can be proved easily to a nearby Moderator that the head shot was intentional and (potentially) caused a serious injury, then the Moderator is permitted to suspend the offending player.
- No vengeance. Offending players may be suspended from play.
- Shot players must sit, unless the shooter was on the shot player's team.
- **Moderators have the final say**, with exceptions. Where the rules are concerned, ask @beackers for clarification.

# Go get 'em!
Please contact @beackers with any questions, concerns, or comments. (that's me.)
