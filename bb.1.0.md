# Straight out of Gimkit, we're bringing Boss Battles!
When it comes to Nerf wars, are you the boss? It's one versus the rest. Good luck... and don't get killed.

# Roles
## Moderators
They, um, moderate, the game. As usual. In this mode they don't get lights-out abilities.
## The Boss
It's this one kid. Just one. He/she's their own captain.<br>
(Big hint: one boss for every 7 players.) They get the weapon priority.
## The Rest
Literally everybody else. They get the rest of the weapons.

# Rules
## Setup
1. Define the play area: boundaries, no-fire zones, off-limits areas, all that. **Make sure everyone knows, understands, and respects these boundaries.** Moderators can suspend players with no regard for limits.
2. The boss(es) get weapons first, and one full clip of darts for their weapon of choice. **ONE** full load. However many darts the gun carries, they get.
3. The Rest get the remaining guns and ammunition to sort out among themselves.
4. Start on opposite corners of the building. Good luck!

## Play

- As always, no penalties for head shots unless it can be proved to the nearest Moderator that it was deliberate, in which case the offending player can be suspended.
- Any shot player (unless a Deliberate Head Shot event occurs) is sidelined and **must** stay out of the remainder of the game.
- Moderators (with exceptions) are the final authority. Contact @beackers for clarification of rules.

# Good luck, bosses!
