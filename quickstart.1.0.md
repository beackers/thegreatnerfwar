# The game
**The basic basics (of the game)**
Players shoot at each other. With Nerf guns.

## the not basics
**OBJECT: Capture as much of the building as possible!**
_based in part off of Splatoon's Turf War_

**setup**
1. Start by pooling all of the weapons and ammunition together.
2. Next, divide the total players into two teams. Let the teams establish captains.
3. Each team receives exactly half the weapons/ammo. Teams may have an excess or a lack of weapons depending on how many team members there are. If there are leftovers attempt to distribute them evenly, setting aside the remaining weapon/dart (if applicable).
4. Establish the out-of-bounds areas or no-fire areas, if any. **IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO THIS _BEFORE_ THE GAME!!!**
By definition:
    - Out-of-bounds: NO players are allowed to enter.
    - No-fire areas: Players are allowed to enter but no shots are allowed inside the boundaries.
5. Team captains choose a "base" on opposing corners of the building. (note to moderators: let the captains decide which corners!)
6. Team captains establish roles within each team.

## play
The game starts when a moderator with a ~gun~ whistle and ~fires a bullet through the ceiling~ blows the whistle. (Hopefully this is a loud whistle and not a quiet whistle so both teams can hear it!)
Teams start to take over the hallways. Shots are fired.
Moderators walk through the hallways, monitoring the war.
**Simple. In theory.**
## rules
- **Modified blasters/darts ARE permitted, with limits.** Darts must not harm players. Blasters cannot resemble real guns, and **if the blaster is modified, the muzzle (dart exit) MUST be kept orange.**
- Head shots never count, no matter the circumstances. (no penalty is offered because this is a really easy thing to do- once, two seconds after picking up my blaster, I shot my brother in the nose.)
- Shot players must return to their base.
